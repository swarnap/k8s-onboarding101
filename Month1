So, you are excited about kubernetes and want to get started!  Yay, welcome!
There are so many resources available online that you find it overwhelming.  Well, you're not alone.

This is how I got started. 
It seems to be working for me, but please feel free to let me know what works(ed) for you.

  Learn the basics first. What is kubernetes?  And more importantly, what ISN'T kubernetes?

  While blog.kubernetes.io is a great place to read up, their first post from March 2015 is still helpful!

  Cloud Native Computing Foundation
  This is an open source foundation that hosts several projects including Kubernetes.
  https://www.cncf.io/
  CNCF, as any other community, is always looking for volunteers and welcomes any help.  Examples include:
      Staffing CNCF booth at key industry events (DockerCon, KubeCon, Google NEXT, OpenStack Summit, etc.)
      Educational and informational articles for The New Stack and other such publications
      Documentation (if you're not technical, ask if there are any non-technical docs/topics that need attention)
      Webinars (reach out to Mark Coleman to brainstorm on ideas and how you can help)
      Meetups (host/organize/sponsor, if possible)
        https://www.meetup.com/pro/cncf/
        https://www.meetup.com/topics/kubernetes/

If you're still not sure how/where to get started, just ask.  Reach out to anyone in the #kubernetes community 
on Slack or GitHub or Twitter.
      
  
  Stay in touch on social
  Slack (especially #kubernetes-novice) is a great way to ask questions

  If you're interested and if you have a technical background, 
  you can also look through GitHub issues (open and closed) and help.

    Remember, any help is welcome and greatly appreciated.
