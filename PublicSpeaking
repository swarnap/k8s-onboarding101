Share your experiences.  There are always newcomers in a community that are seeking to learn
from folks that have "been there, done that."

Consider sharing your experiences:
  At a local meetup
  Virtual panels
  1:1 discussions
  Mentoring
  Speaking opportunities at industry events (kubecon, dockercon, etc. being some examples)

Best practices for submitting a speaking proposal abstract:
    Make it personal.  People often want to hear about how your experiences and lessons have shaped you.
    Empathize with submission reviewers.  What would you want to read in a proposal?
    What is the ONE takeaway you plan to share in your session?
    Tell a story...about yourself and how you learned from your experiences.
    Finally, re-read the abstract before submitting - does it tell the story you plan to share in the session?
    Ask and you shall get.  People are willing to take time and provide feedback; just ask politely.
