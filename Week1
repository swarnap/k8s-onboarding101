So, you are excited about kubernetes and want to get started!  Yay, welcome!
There are so many resources available online that you find it overwhelming.  Well, you're not alone.

This is how I got started. 
It seems to be working for me, but please feel free to let me know what works(ed) for you.

  Learn the basics first. What is kubernetes?  And more importantly, what ISN'T kubernetes?

  While blog.kubernetes.io is a great place to read up, their first post from March 2015 is still helpful!

  Jump in:
    Find the nearest kubernetes meetup group and join the next meetup!
    Or, even better - organize/sponsor/host an upcoming meetup (if that is possible)
    Look through the CNCF meetup groups list: 
      https://www.meetup.com/pro/cncf/
    Or, search for "kubernetes" meetups: 
      https://www.meetup.com/topics/kubernetes/
  
  Stay in touch on social
  Slack (especially #kubernetes-novice) is a great way to ask questions
  https://kubernetes.slack.com

  Look through GitHub issues (open and closed) to see if anyone else ran into the same issue
